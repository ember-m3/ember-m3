# ember-m3 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hjdivad/ember-m3.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hjdivad/ember-m3)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/hjdivad/ember-m3.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This addon provides an alternative model implementation to `DS.Model` that is
compatible with the rest of the [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) ecosystem.

## Background

Ember-data users define their schemas via `DS.Model` classes which explicitly
state what attributes and relationships they expect. Having many such classes
each explicitly defining their schemas provides a lot of clarity and a pleasant
environment for implementing standard object oriented principles.

However, it can be an issue in environments where the API responses are not
easily known in advance, or where they are so varied as to require thousands of
`DS.Model`s which can be a burden both to developer ergonomics as well as
runtime performance.

---

ember-m3 lets you use a single class for many API endpoints, inferring the
schema from the payload and API-specific conventions.

For example, if your API returns responses like the following:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "id": "isbn:9780439708180",
    "type": "com.example.bookstore.Book",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
      "author": "urn:Author:3",
      "chapters": [{
        "name": "The Boy Who Lived",
        "mentionedCharacters": ["urn:Character:harry"],
        "readerComments": [{
          "id": "urn:ReaderComment:1",
          "type": "com.example.bookstore.ReaderComment",
          "name": "Someone or Other",
          "body": "I have it on good authority that this is part of a book of some kind",
        }]
      }],
    },
  },
  "included": [{
    "id": "urn:author:3",
    "type": "com.example.bookstore.Author",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "JK Rowling",
    },
  }],
}
```

You could support it with the following schema:

```js
// app/services/m3-schema.js
//
// generated via `ember generate m3:schema
import DefaultSchema from 'ember-m3/services/m3-schema';

const BookstoreRegExp = /^com\.example\.bookstore\.*/;
const ISBNRegExp = /^isbn:.*/;
const URNRegExp = /^urn:(\w+):(.*)/;

export default DefaultSchema.extend({
  includesModel(modelName) {
    return BookstoreRegExp.test(modelName);
  },

  computeAttributeReference(key, value, modelName, schemaInterface) {
    if (!value) {
      return;
    }

    let match;

    if (ISBNRegExp.test(value)) {
      return {
        id: value,
        type: 'com.example.bookstore.Book',
      };
    } else if ((match = URNRegExp.exec(value))) {
      return {
        id: match[2],
        type: `com.example.bookstore.${match[1]}`,
      };
    }
  },

  computeNestedModel(key, value, modelName, schemaInterface) {
    if (value && typeof value === 'object') {
      return {
        id: value.id,
        type: value.type,
        attributes: value,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

Notice that in this case, the schema doesn't specify anything model-specific and
would work whether the API returns 3 different kinds of models or 3,000.

Model-specific information _is_ still needed to handle cases that cannot be
generally inferred from the payload (such as distinguishing `Date` fields). See
the [Schema](#Schema) section for details.

## Trade-Offs

The benefits of using ember-m3 over `DS.Model` are:

- handle dynamic schemas whose structure is not known in advance
- handle relationship references at arbitrary points in the payload seamlessly (eg relationship references within POJO attributes)
- limit the payload size of schema information by inferring as much as
  possible from the structure of the payload itself
- more easily query arbitrary URLs, especially when the types of the returned models are
  not known in advance

The trade-offs made for this include:

- Having only one model class prevents the use of some OOP patterns: You can't
  add computed properties to only one model for instance, and will need to
  rely on a different pattern of helpers and utility functions
- Inferring the schema from the payload can make the client side code less
  clear as is often the case in "static" vs. "dynamic" tradeoffs

## Installation

- `ember install ember-m3`

## Querying

The existing store API works as expected. `findRecord`, `queryRecord` &c., will
build a URL using the `-ember-m3` adapter and create a record for the returned
response using `MegamorphicModel`. Note that the actual name queried will be
passed to the adapter so you can build URLs correctly.

For example

```js
store.findRecord('com.example.bookstore.book', 'isbn:9780439708180');
```

Results in an adapter call

```js
import MegamorphicModel from 'ember-m3/model';

findRecord(store, modelClass, id, snapshot) {
  modelClass === MegamorphicModel;
  snapshot.modelName === 'com.example.bookstore.book';
  id === 'isbn:9780439708180';
}
```

ember-m3 does not define an `-ember-m3` adapter but you can define one in your
app. Otherwise the default adapter lookup rules are followed (ie your
`application` adapter will be used).

### Store.queryURL

ember-m3 also adds `store.queryURL`. This is helpful for one-off endpoints or
endpoints where the type returned is not known and you just want a thin wrapper
around the API response that knows how to look up relationships.

```js
store.queryURL(url, options);
```

#### Return Value

Returns a promise that will resolve to

1.  A `MegamorphicModel` if the [primary data][json-api:primary-data] of the normalized response is a resource.
2.  A `RecordArray` of `MegamorphicModel`s if the [primary data][json-api:primary-data] of the normalized response is an array of
    resources.

The raw API response is normalized via the `-ember-m3` serializer. M3 does not
define such a serializer but you can add one to your app if your API requires
normalization to JSON API.

#### Arguments

- `url` The URL path to query. The `-ember-m3` adapter is consulted for its
  `host` and `namespace` properties.

  - When `url` is an absolute URL, (eg `http://bookstore.example.com/books`) or a network-path reference (eg `//books`), the adapter's `host` and `namespace` properties are ignored.
  - When `url` is an absolute path reference (eg `/books`) it is prefixed with the adapter's `host` and/or `namespace` if they are present.
  - When `url` is a relative path reference it is prefixed with the adapter's
    `host` and/or `namespace`, whichever is present. It is an error to call
    `queryURL` when `url` is a relative path reference and the adapter specifies
    neither `host` nor `namespace`.

- `options` additional options. All are optional, as is the `options` object
  itself.

  - `options.method` defaults to `GET`. The HTTP method to use.

  - `options.params` defaults to `null`. The parameters to include, either in the URL (for `GET`
    requests) or request body (for others).

  - `options.cacheKey` defaults to `null`. A string to uniquely identify this
    request. `null` or `undefined` indicates the result should not be cached.
    It is passed to `serializer.normalizeResponse` as the `id` parameter, but
    the serializer is free to ignore it.

  - `options.reload` defaults to `false`. If `true`, make a request even if an
    entry was found under `cacheKey`. Do not resolve the returned promise
    until that request completes.

  - `options.backgroundReload` defaults to `false`. If `true`, make a request
    even if an entry was found under `cacheKey`. If `true` and a cached entry
    was found, resolve the returned promise immediately with the cached entry
    and update the store when the request completes.

#### Caching

When `cacheKey` is provided, the response is cached under `cacheKey`.

If the response contains an model with an id, that model will be cached under that id as
well as under the `cacheKey`. The entry under the model's id and under the `cacheKey` will
point to the same model. Changes to the model will be reflected in both the models
retrieved by `cacheKey` and the models retreived by the model's id.

Using `cacheKey` with `queryURL` can be useful to show, eg dashboard data or any other data
that changes over time.

Consider the following:

```js
store.queryURL('/newsfeed/latest', { cacheKey: 'newsfeed.latest', backgroundReload: true });
```

In this example, the first time the user visits a route that makes this query,
the promise will wait to resolve until the request completes. The second time
the request is made the promise will resolve immediately with the cached values
while loading fresh values in the background.

Note that what is actually cached is the result: ie either a `MegamorphicModel`
or, more likely, a `RecordArray` of `MegamorphicModel`s.

---

It is possible to do the same thing in stock Ember Data by making a `DS.Model`
class to wrap your search results and querying via:

```js
// app/models/news-feed.js
import DS from 'ember-data';
export DS.Model.extend({
  feedItems: DS.hasMany('feed-item'),
});

// somewhere, presumably in a route
store.findRecord('news-feed', 'latest', { backgroundReload: true });
```

As with ember-m3 generally, similar functionality is provided without the need
to create models and relationships within your app code.

##### Cache Eviction

Because models (or `RecordArray`s of models are cached) the cache can be emptied
automatically when the models are unloaded. In the case of `RecordArray`s of
models, the entire cache entry is evicted if _any_ of the member models is
unloaded.

##### Manual Cache Insertion

In cases where we need to manually insert into the cache, we can use `cacheURL`.
As an example, we may need to compute a secondary cache key once we receive
response from our API.

```js
store.queryURL('/foo', { cacheKey }).then(result => {
  const secondaryCacheKey = computeSecondaryCacheKey(result);
  store.cacheURL(secondaryCacheKey, result);
});
```

When we unload the model, we will evict _both_ the initial `cacheKey` as well as
`secondaryCacheKey`.

```js
store.queryURL('/foo', { cacheKey: 'foo' }).then(result => {
  store.cacheURL('bar', result);

  // Cache conceptually looks like: { foo: ..., bar: ...' }
  result.unloadRecord();
  // Cache is now empty
});
```

## Schema

You have to register a schema to tell ember-m3 what types it should be enabled
for, as well as information that cannot be inferred from the response payload.
You can think of the schema as a service that represents the same
information, more or less, as all of your `DS.Model` files.

### What is a schema

When modeling a payload it is necessary to know what properties of the payload
are attributes that should be accessible to the application & templates, what
properties are relationships that should look up other models, and what
properties should be ignored.

`DS.Model` achieves this by enumerating the attributes and relationships on a
`DS.Model` subclass inside your `app/models` directory.

By contrast ember-m3 relies on application-wide conventions to know the
difference between attributes and relationships and otherwise reports all
properties returned by the API as accessible to the application.

For APIs with many models, the ember-m3 approach can produce a substantially
smaller application. Similarly the approach uses fewer classes which reduces
the runtime cost of relationships.

### API

`Schema` is a service registered from `app/services/m3-schema.js`. For convenience
you can extend a default schema from `ember-m3/services/schema`. The `schema` should
have following properties.

- `includesModel(modelName)` Whether or not ember-m3 should handle this
  `modelName`. It's fine to just `return true` here but this hook allows
  `ember-m3` to work alongside `DS.Model`.

- `computeAttributeReference(key, value, modelName, schemaInterface)` A function that determines
  whether an attribute is a reference. If it is not, return `null` or
  `undefined`.
  Otherwise return an object with properties:

  - `id` The id of the referenced model (either m3 or `DS.Model`)
  - `type` The type of the referenced model (either m3 or `DS.Model`),

  `null` is also a valid type in which case `id` will be looked up in a global cache.

  Note that attribute references are all treated as synchronous. There is no
  ember-m3 analogue to `DS.Model` async relationships.

- `computeNestedModel(key, value, modelName, schemaInterface)` Whether `value` should be treated
  as a nested model. Useful for deeply nested references, eg with the following
  data:

  ```js
  {
    id: 1,
    type: 'com.example.library.book',
    attributes: {
      bestChapter: {
        number: 7,
        characterPOV: 'urn:character:2'
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  We would want `model.get('bestChapter.characterPOV')` to return the
  `character` model with id `2`, but this requires that the `bestChapter`
  attribute is treated as a nested m3 model and not a simple object.

  If `value` is a nested model, `computeNestedModel` must return an object with
  the properties `id`, `type` and `attributes`. It is fine for this to simply
  treat all objects as nested models (be careful with transforms; you may
  want to explicitly check `value.constructor`). eg

  ```js
  computeNestedModel(key, value, modelName, schemaInterface) {
    if(value && value.constructor === Object) {
      return {
        id: value.id,
        type: value.type,
        attributes: value,
      };
    }
  }
  ```

- `setAttribute(modelName, attrName, value, schemaInterface)` A function that can be used
  to update the record-data with raw value instead of resolved value.
  `schemaInterface.setAttr(key,value)` should be invoked inside the function to set
  the value. If this function is not provided, m3 will set value as is.

  Example:

  ```js
  setAttribute(modelName, attrName, value, schemaInterface) {
    // Check if the value is resolved as model
    // update attribute record-data with id information.
    if (value && value.constructor && value.constructor.isModel) {
      schemaInterface.setAttr(attrName, value.get('id'));
    }
  }
  ```

- `computeAttributes(keys, modelName)` Compute the actual attribute names, default just return the
  array passed in.
  This is useful if you need to "decode/encode" your attribute names in a certain form, e.g.,
  add a prefix when serializing.

- `models` an object containing type-specific information that cannot be
  inferred from the payload. The `models` property has the form:

  ```js
  {
    models: {
      myModelName: {
        attributes: [],
        defaults: {
          attributeName: 'defaultValue',
        },
        aliases: {
          aliasName: 'attributeName',
        }
        transforms: {
          attributeName: transformFunctionn /* value */
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The keys to `models` are the types of your models, as they exist in your
  normalized payload.

  - `attributes` A list of whitelisted attributes. It is recommended to omit
    this unless you explicitly want to prevent unknown properties returned in
    the API payload from being read. If present, it is an array of strings that
    list whitelisted attributes. Reads of non-whitelisted properties will
    return `undefined`.

  - `defaults` An object whose key-value pairs map attribute names to default
    values. Reads of properties not included in the API will return the default
    value instead, if it is specified in the schema.

  - `aliases` Alternate names for payload attributes. Aliases are read-only, ie
    equivalent to `Ember.computed.reads` and not `Ember.computed.alias`

  - `transforms` An object whose key-value pairs map attribute names to
    functions that transform their values. This is useful to handle attributes
    that should be treated as `Date`s instead of strings, for instance.

    ```js
    function dateTransform(value) {
      if (!value) { return; }
      return new Date(Date.parse());
    }

    {
      models: {
        'com.example.bookstore.book': {
          transforms: {
            publishDate: dateTransform,
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Serializer / Adapter

ember-m3 will use the `-ember-m3` adapter to make queries via `findRecord`,
`queryRecord`, `queryURL` &c. Responses will be normalized via the `-ember-m3`
serializer.

ember-m3 provides neither an adapter nor a serializer. If your app does not
define an `-ember-m3` adapter, the normal lookup rules are followed and your
`application` adapter is used instead

It is perfectly fine to use your `application` adapter and serializer. However,
if you have an app that uses both m3 models as well as `DS.Model`s you may
want to have different request headers, serialization or normalization for
your m3 models. The `-ember-m3` adapter and serializer are the appropriate
places for this.

## Alternative Patterns

If you are converting an application that uses `DS.Model`s (perhaps because it
has a very large number of them and ember-m3 can help with performance) you may
have some patterns in your model classes beyond schema specification.

There are no particular requirements around refactoring these except that when
you only have a single class for your models you won't be able to use typical
object-oriented patterns.

The following are simply recommendations for common patterns.

### Constants

Use the schema `defaults` feature to replace constant values in your `DS.Model`
classes. For example:

```js
// app/models/my-model.js
export DS.Model.extend({
  myConstant: 24601,
});

// convert to

// app/initializers/schema-initializer.js
{
  models: {
    'my-model': {
      defaults: {
        myConstant: 24601,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ember.computed.reads

Use the schema `aliases` feature to replace use of `Ember.computed.reads`. You
can likely do this also to replace the use of `Ember.computed.alias` as quite
often they can be read only.

```js
// app/models/my-model.js
export DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr(),
  aliasName: Ember.computed.reads('name'),
});

// convert to

// app/initializers/schema-initializer.js
{
  models: {
    'my-model': {
      aliases: {
        aliasName: 'name',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Random UI State or other non-attr non-relationship properties

Let's say you are converting the following `Museum` model:

```js
// models/museum.js
export DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr(),
})
```

And that for `Bad Reasons™` you discover that your team has been stashing a custom
object on the museum describing some ad-hoc state (maybe for the ui?):

```js
Ember.set(museum, 'retrofit', retrofitState);
```

Let's say this state has a formal class:

```js
const RetrofitState = Ember.Object.extend({
  statusText: Ember.computed('statusCode', function() {
    let code = this.get('statusCode');

    switch (code) {
      case 0:
        return 'Not started';
      case 1:
        return 'In Progress';
      case 2:
        return 'Incomplete, on hold';
      case 3:
        return 'Completed';
      default:
        return 'Unknown';
    }
  }),
});
```

While you should not store local-state/ui-state (e.g. any state not part of the schema) on records, you can make this
pattern temporarily work with `M3` by doing a `Bad Thing™` and giving the class constructor a static `isModel` flag:

```js
RetrofitState.isModel = true; // THIS COMES WITH CONSEQUENCES
```

This is not without consequences. Setting this flag makes `M3` treat this object as a `resolvedValue`, meaning that **it
will be included as an attribute when snapshot.eachAttribute is called by a serializer**. This is very likely not what
you want and very likely will cause "spooky action at a distance" bugs for others on your team (like suddenly sending
serialized information about retrofits to the API).

Before saving these records, you would need to carefully scrub it by deleting this and any other local properties off of
it, or you would need to ensure that the serializer did not serialize this attribute. This will be tedious, annoying and
brittle, but that is the sacrifice paid for such `Bad Things™`.

Ultimately, you should refactor your application away from this `Bad Practice™` to pass these separate objects alongside
each other, for instance by wrapping them in an hash like the following:

```js
let museumRetrofit = {
  museum,
  retrofit,
};
```

### Other Computed Properties

More involved computed properites can be converted to either utility functions
(if used within JavaScript) or helper functions (if used in templates).

For properties used in both templates and elsewhere (eg components) a convenient
pattern is to define a helper that exports both.

```js
// app/models/my-model.js
export DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  sillyName: Ember.computed('name', function() {
    return `silly ${this.get('name')}`;
  }).readOnly(),
});
```

```hbs
{{! some-template.hbs }}
{{model.sillyName}}
{{my-component name=model.sillyName}}
```

```js
// app/routes/index.js
let sn = model.get('sillyName');
```

Coverted to

```js
// app/helpers/silly-name.js
export function getSillyName(model) {
  if (!model) {
    return;
  }
  return `silly ${model.get('name')}`;
}

function sillyNameHelper(positionalArgs) {
  if (positionalArgs.length < 1) {
    return;
  }

  return getSillyName(positionalArgs[0]);
}

export default Ember.Helper.helper(sillyNameHelper);
```

```hbs
{{! some-template.hbs }}
{{silly-name model}}
{{my-component name=(silly-name model)}}
```

```js
// app/routes/index.js
import { getSillyName } from '../helpers/silly-name';

// ...
let sn = getSillyName(model);
```

### Saving

ember-m3 does not impose any particular requirements with saving models. If
your endpoints cannot reliably be determined via `snapshot.modelName` it is
recommended to add support for `adapterOptions.url` in your adapter. For
example:

```js
// app/adapters/-ember-m3.js
import ApplicationAdapter from './application';
export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
  findRecord(store, type, id, snapshot) {
    let adapterOptions = snapshot.adapterOptions || {};
    let url = adapterOptions.url;
    if (!url) {
      url = this.buildURL(snapshot.modelName, id, snapshot, 'findRecord');
    }

    return this.ajax(url, 'GET');
  },

  // &c.
});

// somewhere else, perhaps in a route
this.store.findRecord('com.example.bookstore.book', 1, { url: '/book/from/surprising/endpoint' });
```
